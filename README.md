# FTPCommander
FTPCommander is a console application that uses the FluentFTP library getting the data from a configuration file. This allows an easy and fast control through RPA
but prevents the use or commands or FTP applications, being faster and reliable. Moreover, files from a remoteFolder can be filtered more efficiently by
last modified date range, Regex pattern of the files and the type of the entities(Files, Folders or anything)
